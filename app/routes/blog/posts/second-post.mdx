# System Architecture v2.0

The new interface operates on a strictly **monospaced** visual grid. All organic curves have been purged from the system in favor of `rounded-none` efficiency.

## Core Protocols

1.  **Visual Clarity**: High contrast text against deep backgrounds.
2.  **Efficiency**: No wasted padding or decorative fluff.
3.  **Responsiveness**: Adapts to any viewport stream.

## Code Implementation

Here is a snippet of the styles used to generate the **Checkbox** component:

```tsx
const boxStyles = tv({
  extend: focusRing,
  base: "w-4.5 h-4.5 box-border shrink-0 rounded-none flex items-center justify-center border transition bg-app-background",
  variants: {
    isSelected: {
      false: "border-primary-muted group-pressed:border-primary-vivid",
      true: "bg-primary-muted border-primary-muted group-pressed:border-primary-vivid group-pressed:bg-primary-vivid forced-colors:[--color:Highlight]!",
    },
    isInvalid: {
      true: "border-ruby-muted group-pressed:border-ruby-vivid",
    },
  },
})
```
